# ðŸŽ¡ Welcome to Luna Park

[Luna Park](https://luna-park.app) is a visual scripting editor for the web. Faster and easier than code, more flexible and performant than no-code, visual scripting makes software development accessible to anyone.

You can try out the editor on the [Luna Park website](https://luna-park.app). If you want to learn how to use visual scripting, you can take up the [Luna Park challenge](https://luna-park.app/challenge), a series of puzzle that will teach you the basics in a gamified way.
